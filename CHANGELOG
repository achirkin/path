UNRELEASED:
	* Old extension operations "addFileExtension" and "setFileExtension" have
		been deprecated and replaced by "addExtension" and "replaceExtension"
		respectively.
		ADAPTING YOUR CODE TO THIS CHANGE:
		* Code that sets an extension not starting with a "." e.g.  "foo", must
		  be changed such that it starts with a "." i.e. ".foo".
		* Code that sets multiple extensions in one go e.g. ".tar.gz" must be
		  changed to set them one at a time instead i.e. add ".tar" first and
		  then add ".gz".
		* Code that sets an extension starting with multiple dots e.g.
		  "..foo" must be changed such as to make the extra dots part of the
		  file name instead.
		Details:
		The new operations "addExtension" and "replaceExtension" accept only "valid"
		extension forms which is exactly the same as what "fileExtension" returns.
		A valid extension starts with a @.@ followed by one or more characters
		not including @.@ followed by zero or more @.@s in trailing position.
		This change allows extension operations to be principled following
		these laws:
		* (fileExtension . fromJust . addExtension ext) f == ext
		* replaceExtension (fileExtension f) f == Just f
	* Add 'Path.Posix' and 'Path.Windows' modules for manipulating
		Windows or Posix style paths independently of the current platform.
	* Add 'Lift' instance for 'Path'.

0.6.1:
	* Add 'addFileExtension' function and its operator form: (<.>).
	* Derive 'Eq' instance for 'PathException'.

0.6.0:

	* Deprecate PathParseException and rename it to PathException
	* Allow 'parent' to work on relative paths as well
	* Deprecate isParentOf and stripDir and rename them to isProperPrefixOf and
	  stripProperPrefix respectively.
	* Allow "." as a valid relative dir path with the following rules:
		* "./" </> "./" = "./"
		* "./" </> "x/" = "x/"
		* "x/" </> "./" = "x/"
		* dirname "x" = "./"
		* dirname "/" = "./"
		* dirname "./" = "./"
	* Make dirname return "." instead of "/" (fixes #18).
	* Remove the 'validity' flag.
	* Add synonym for setFileExtension in the form of an operator: (-<.>).
